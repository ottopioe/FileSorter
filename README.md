# FileSorter
Automatically sorts files into folders based on the file type.

# Description
This program intends to automise file sorting. As a developer myself, a lot of junk piles up in the downloads folder. That is why this program is useful.

It sorts the files in the following categories:
	Images
	Videos
	Documents
	Apps
	Music
	Coding Files
	Zips
	Others

# Instructions
These folders should exist in your downloads folder. If they don't, the program automatically creates them for you.
If it is the first time using this program, you will have to input the location of your downloads folder. Once you have done that once, it saves that information and won't ask again next time.

This program is intended to work in the background. It always checks for new files in your downloads folder, so if you don't want a certain file to be sorter, make sure you close the program!

I hope this makes your life easier.
